## CNC Vertical Mill

### Get Started

1. Turn on the power strip under the mill table
2. Turn on the computer under the mill
3. Turn on the CNC control box - the box under the mill table
4. Pull out the Emergency stop on the left side of the mill
5. Start Mach 3. There are two configurations, one for the benchtop mill and one for the dental mill. 

### Shut down
1. Shutdown the computer
2. Turn off the CNC Control box
3. Turn off the power strip under the mill table

### Work Holding

The easy way is to start with foam blocks and double sided tape. After that, when moving to heavier materials it turns out that 
securing the work is one of the big challenges of CNC work. We have 
a vise for smaller work, and a [Harbor Freight clamping kit](http://manuals.harborfreight.com/manuals/90000-90999/90752.pdf).
