## The Warehouse

In April of 2016, Chimera successfully moved into our newly retro-fitted 3,000 suare foot warehouse space at the back of the old Ford building on Hwy 12 in Sebastopol. The beautifully designed and well-lit space has plenty of room for co-working, as well as a kitchen, a comfortable lounge/library/meeting area, a fully outfitted jewelry studio, an electronics lab, 3D printers, a small crafts and textiles area, a 4,000 square foot outside space for welding and other large projects, lockers, a machine shop area with CNC machines and a small laser cutter, and coming soon, a brand new 3' x 4' 100 watt laser cutter!
