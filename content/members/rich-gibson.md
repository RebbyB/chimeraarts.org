I've been a software developer and general technologist 'forever.' I wrote books on Mapping for O'Reilly, speak at conferences, and build cocktail robots.

Since 2007 I've been fixated on multi image photography. I worked on the GigaPan project for 3 years, and I've designed and built cnc controlled photography rigs which allow us to capture high resolution explorable images..
